## Predicting-water-pump-functionality-in-Tanzania

# Summary
Water is crucial to increase quality of living in rural areas. Using data provided by Tanzania Ministry of Water, I developed a supervised classification model to predict which water pumps need repairs or are totally broken.

# Data
Predictive model is trained on data from Taarifa, which aggregates the data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. You may find and download the data here https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/ after signing up for the competition. The training data consists of over 50,000 records of Tanzanian water well pumps across the country and includes features about their location, when they were installed, who installed them, what kind of pump they are, etc., as well as their current functioning status - functional, non-functional, or functional but needs repair.
